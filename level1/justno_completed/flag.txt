flag is 08c0c2008f63cd44596dc13be08dd3ac

How to solve.

I identified that the authentication file was being called using relative paths.
Therefore i tried to copy the code file and then edit it to refer to a spoofed auth file.
It didnt work the error was segmentation fault.
Segmentation fault is when there is a memory error in the program.

Couldnt find a solution but knew my approach was right.

Apparently when you create a symbolic link to a program (shortcut) and it is executed.
The program is executed from the directory where the shortcut exists,
therefore specifiying a spoofed auth file from that directory gets you the flag.
