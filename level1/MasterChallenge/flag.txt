The challenge is to login to a webpage.

How to solve.

If you check the source of the webpage it shows that it has client side scripting.
Which seems to validate the login password from the client side and then send a respone to the server.
Inject the post packet from the browser with value "true" and it should respond with the flag.

This process can also be done using the shell on the program called curl.
