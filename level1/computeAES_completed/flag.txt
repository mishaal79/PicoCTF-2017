How to solve

The key and cipher are both base64 encoded
the encryption used is aes-128-ebc

What is ebc ?

ebc always produces the same encryption for the same password.

What is cbc ?

cbc produces random encryptions for same pasword.

Step 1 -> determine the tools to decrypt aes-128-ebc

openssl does the decryption and also decodes the base64 cipher file.
it only takes in hex blocks as key.

Step 2 -> convert the key into hex from base64 .
Use online tool or base64conv - this tool adds additional chars at the end.

nopad option in openssl is used when there is a block error because the encryption
might have been done without a padding block.
bad magic number error is given when the key given is not correct.

command used,

openssl enc -aes-128-ebc -d -a -in {input file} -out {output file} -K {Hex key block} || -kfile {file of hex key} -nopad
