Hash101 challenge
level 1 - convert a binary to ascii
level 2 - convert the ascii to hex
level 3 - covert the hex to decimal
level 4 - a unique hash function specified in which when all the bytes
          all the bytes of a string are summed and mod 16 the remainder is a
          value given by challenge.
          find the string or set of chars which gives that value.
level 5 - google for the md5 hash and check whether it has been cracked already.
<<<<<<<<=====How to Solve===========>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
use python int function to do the conversion from binary to hex and then to ascii
use python to convert the ascii into int or given binary to hex.
use python to convert the hex or binary into decimal
use ascii table to check the character values which when mod by 16
gives the desired remainder.
